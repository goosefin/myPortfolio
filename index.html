            <p class="title">About Me</p>

            <p>My name is Agustina Fin but I go by Goose. I began my career as a small business owner working in the pet service industry. Like any company in todays day and age I needed a website and this is where my interest in web development began. I spent a lot of time creating a site that would reflect my passion for my business but quickly realized that the platform I was using limited my creativity.</p>

            <p>After dabbling with youtube tutorials I signed up for a Udemy course to expand on my newly aquired skills and I quickly realized how amazing bringing my ideas from a concept to a functional application was. Shortly after I signed up for a software engineering bootcamp and that leads me to today!</p>

            <p>I've now built out muliple projects with a variety of languages and continue learning all there is to this ever expanding industry</p>

            <p>Here are some of the languages and frameworks in my repertoir, check out my resume for the full list:</p>

                        I am a huge fan of books, specifically paperback and hardcovers. I have over 200 books in my library some of which I've read, others I havent and some books I dont even rememebr buying. I created a digital library for people who want to track their reviews, write down their thoughts and otherwise keep their home libraries organized.
